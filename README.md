Atlas React and JSX ProjectThis project is a basic static website built with React and JSX. The primary goal is to learn and apply fundamental React concepts, including local development workflows, component-based architecture, and props.üöÄ Project OverviewIn this project, we are building a simple static site to practice the benefits of decomposing a user interface into smaller, declarative, and reusable components. The focus is on understanding the core mechanics of React and its syntax extension, JSX, without the complexity of advanced state management or styling. All necessary styles are provided in index.css.Learning ObjectivesUnderstand how to set up and run a local development environment for a React application using Vite.Gain proficiency in creating React components with JSX.Understand how to pass data between components using props.Learn the process of building and deploying a React application to the cloud.üõ†Ô∏è Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.PrerequisitesYou need to have Node.js installed on your machine. The latest LTS (Long Term Support) version is recommended.InstallationClone the repository:git clone <your-repository-url>
cd atlas-react-and-jsx
Install dependencies:Run the following command in your terminal to install all the necessary packages defined in package.json.npm install
Start the development server:This command will start the Vite development server.npm run dev
Open the application:Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 (or the URL provided in your terminal).‚úÖ Project ProgressMilestone 1: React Setup (Complete)Task: Correctly render the main App component to the DOM.File Modified: src/main.jsxDetails: The application was successfully configured to use the modern createRoot API from react-dom/client to mount the <App /> component into the <div id="root"> element in index.html. This completes the initial setup phase of the project.üíª Tech StackReact: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.JSX: A syntax extension for JavaScript used with React to describe what the UI should look like.Vite: A modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment.
